I am currently a senior at the University of Utah, majoring in mathematics and minoring in computer science. I have worked on a variety of projects, ranging from unsupervised NLP embedding methods to game theory simulations. I am currently working on a project to create a novel method for deep archetypal analysis, with the aim of creating highly interpretable latent spaces. These tools are used to analyze the white supremicist forum iron march.",
